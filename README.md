# Hi, I'm Shrey 👋🏾 💻

I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Some languages I enjoy working with include JavaScript, Python and C++. Currently, in School, I am learning about Data Structures, Algorithm's, and low-level machine code languages such as MIPS and ARM. I am also learning about Full Stack Web Development as well as the SDLC on the side! In my free time, I like to play basketball, listen to music or play some video games!
